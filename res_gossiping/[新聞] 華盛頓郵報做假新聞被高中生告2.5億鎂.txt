Washington Post settles $250M suit with Covington teen Nick Sandmann

4.完整新聞內文:

The Washington Post on Friday agreed to settle a monster $250 million lawsuit
filed by Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann over its
botched coverage of his 2019 encounter with a Native American elder.
Sandmann declared the victory in a tweet on his 18th birthday. It’s unclear
how much the newspaper settled for.

“On 2/19/19, I filed $250M defamation lawsuit against Washington Post.
Today, I turned 18 & WaPo settled my lawsuit,” he wrote.
“Thanks to @ToddMcMurtry & @LLinWood for their advocacy. Thanks to my family
& millions of you who have stood your ground by supporting me. I still have
more to do,” he continued.

It’s the teen’s second win in a whopping $800 million defamation battle
against a number of news outlets including the Washington Post, CNN, ABC,
CBS, The Guardian, The Hill and NBC.
CNN agreed to settle with Sandmann in January this year as part of a separate
$275 million claim.

Sandmann and a group of his Covington classmates were vilified on social
media after they were filmed wearing “Make America Great Again” hats after
an anti-abortion rally while being yelled at by demonstrators.

encounter.

Sandmann, then 16, was singled out after footage of his confrontation with
Native American activist Nathan Phillips was picked up by CNN and other
outlets who claimed the incident was racially motivated.
Footage released later showed it was the Covington students who were being
harassed.
In a subsequent tweet Friday, Sandmann fired a warning shot at Twitter CEO
Jack Dorsey.
“We have settled with WAPO and CNN. The fight isn’t over. 2 down. 6 to go.
Don’t hold your breath @jack,” he wrote.


翻譯不好大家可以自己去看.

大意就是去年初有一班高中生放假沒事去參加了反墮胎遊行, 然後遇到也是在附近倡議原
住民活動的老人家起了衝突, 然後被一堆新聞寫成了這些小屁孩對原民老人種族歧視引起
很大的爭議. 但是其實從很多影片可以看到是老人家自己7pupu在搞事,高中生什麼都沒做
讓他罵爽 (感覺在台灣也似曾相似). 但因為是CNN, Washington Post, ABC, CBS, The
Guardian, The Hill, NBC這些大媒體單方面在報導, 所以變成高中生和家人們被誤解和
背負輿論壓力.

所以他們最後就告了這些好棒棒做假新聞的媒體們8億鎂 (誰還跟你買威力彩), 然後現在
華郵的2.5億訴訟和解了 (先前CNN也和解了2.75億鎂), 剩其他的六間挫咧但.
